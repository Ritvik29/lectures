# Lectures
This repository holds the lecture notes for the class.  Be aware that I may 
update the lecture notes after they are posted.  Periodically check the most recent commit date and comment to see if you have the most recent version. A better strategy would be the use github to update your local version of the
repository (e.g. git clone the repository and then update it with git pull).

# Class Schedule
I will try to keep this updated as to the notes/slides we cover
for each day:

Date    | Slides
--------|--------
Aug. 26 | We went over the syllabus and	gave a high level overview of what the course will entail.  Additionally, we defined some common terms/concepts that will be used throughout the course.
Aug. 28 | We discussed missing data and imputation. We talked about some unsupervised imputation schemes and start to explore R Markdown via a simulation involving missing data and imputation
Sep. 02 | We covered aspects of the multivariate normal distribution.
Sep. 04 | We began talking about graphical models.  We discussed covariance and correlation graphs as well as inference using the Wishart distribution.
Sep. 09 | We discussed partial correlation graphical models and inference using the bootstrap.  We then introduced PCA.
Sep. 11 | We talked about two related methods of generalizing PCA: MDS and KPCA.  MDS operates on the pairwise dissimilarities which KPCA nonlinearizes PCA by inserting a general kernel in for the Euclidean inner product.
Sep. 16 | We began looking at clustering by covering K-means clustering and beginning to talk about Hierarchical clustering
Sep. 18 | Finished talking about Hierarchical clustering and briefly discussed density-based (i.e. soft) clustering
Sep. 23 | We began discussing supervised learning, defining risk, loss, and Bayes' rules
Sep. 25 | We discuss various estimators of the Risk
Sep. 30 | Stepwise selection procedures: global and local solutions to a non-convex optimization problem
Oct. 02 | Ridge regression
Oct. 07 | Lasso regression
Oct. 09 | In class exercise on coordinate descent for regression and the lasso.  Introduce elastic net and refitted lasso
Oct. 14 | Midterm Review
Oct. 16 | Relaxed lasso and in class exercise on batch gradient descent [Midterm from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm in BLOC 149]
Oct. 21 | Defining risk for classification and logistic regression
Oct. 23 | Linear classifiers and the logistic elastic net
Oct. 28 | Evaluating classifiers
Oct. 30 | Nonparametric methods
Nov. 04 | Decision Trees
Nov. 06 | Bagging and random forest
Nov. 11 |
Nov. 13 |
Nov. 18 |
Nov. 20 |
Nov. 25 |
Nov. 27 | Thanksgiving, no class
Dec. 02 | Friday schedule, no class
Dec. 04 | Review for Final
Dec. 09 | Final, 3:30 to 5:30 pm

**Note** The final is determined by the university and cannot be changed
